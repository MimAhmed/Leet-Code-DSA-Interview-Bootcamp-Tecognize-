#### What is Object Oriented Programming?
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm.Object-oriented programming is based on the concept of objects. In object-oriented programming data structures, or objects are defined, each with its own properties or attributes. Each object can also contain its own procedures or methods
## What is a Class?
Collection of objects is called class. It is a logical entity. Class is named group of Properties and Functions. Instance of class is an *** Object ***.

#### What is an Object?
In computer science, an object can be a variable, a data structure, a function, or a method, and as such, is a value in memory referenced by an identifier.

In the object-oriented programming paradigm, object can be a combination of variables, functions, and data structures; in particular in class-based variations of the paradigm it refers to a particular instance of a class.



## Why OOP ?
- OOP provides a clear modular structure for programs
- OOP makes it easy to maintain and modify existing code
- It is suitable for realword problems and real world works

## 4 Pillars  of OOP
****
1. Abstraction
2. Encapsulation
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism

#### What is Abstraction in OOP?
Abstraction is used to hide background details or any unnecessary implementation about the data so that users only see the required information. It is one of the most important and essential features of object-oriented programming.

> Pre-defined functions are similar to data abstraction.

#### What is Encapsulation?
Encapsulation in OOP Meaning: In object-oriented computer programming languages, the notion of encapsulation refers to the bundling of data, along with the methods that operate on that data, into a single unit.

> Many programming languages use encapsulation frequently in the form of classes.

#### What is Inheritance?
Inheritance is a mechanism that allows one class to gain the properties of another class, in the same way, that a child inherits some attributes from each of their parents. 

> Inheritance allows programmers to create a new class that reuses the data members and methods of an existing class.

#### What is Polymorphism?
Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms.

#### Stack and Heap Memory
When a program is running, it takes up memory. Sometimes we are not even aware of the memory being allocated. In fact, every time you create a new variable, your program is allocating more memory for you to store that variable. This article focuses on two kinds of memories: stack and heap.

#### What is Stack?
It is an array of memory.

It is a LIFO (Last In First Out) data structure.

In it data can be added to and deleted only from the top of it.

#### Basic Operations

**push() − Pushing (storing) an element on the stack.**

**pop() − Removing (accessing) an element from the stack**

#### Whats is Heap?
It is an area of memory where chunks are allocated to store certain kinds of data objects.

In it data can be stored and removed in any order.
#### Heap vs Stack
Stack and Heap does not have a physical representation - it is a memory abstraction, so there is not physical difference between them, they are both in RAM.

### What is Palindrome String?
A string is said to be a palindrome if the string read from left to right is equal to the string read from right to left.
