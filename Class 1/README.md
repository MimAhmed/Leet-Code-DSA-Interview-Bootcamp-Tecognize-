#### What is an Algorithm?
An algorithm is a set of instructions for solving a problem or accomplishing a task.

#### What is Data Structure?
Data Structure is a way of collecting and organising data in such a way that we can perform operations on these data in an effective way.

Basic Data Structure Discussion
**1.** Array
**2.** List in Python

## What is List in Python
A list is a data structure in Python that is a mutable, or changeable, ordered sequence of elements. Each element or value that is inside of a list is called an item. Just as strings are defined as characters between quotes, lists are defined by having values between square brackets [ ] .

## How Array or List Works
An array is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or variables), each identified by at least one array index or key.

## Defining an Array or List in Python
#### Empty List
ages = []
#### List With Values
ages = [49, 48, 26, 19, 16]

#### How List Store Data

#### What is Notations?
There are different notations we can use to express space complexity measurements. The most widely used is big-O notation, and that’ll be our main focus. Also, we’ll briefly define other common notations.

#### What is Complexity?
Complexity of an algorithm is a measure of the amount of time and/or space required by an algorithm for an input of a given size (n).

#### Types of Complexity?
1. Time Complexity
2. Space Complexity

#### Time Complexity
Time complexity of an algorithm signifies the total time required by the program to run till its completion.

The time complexity of algorithms is most commonly expressed using the big O notation. It's an asymptotic notation to represent the time complexity.


#### Space Complexity
Space complexity measures the total amount of memory that an algorithm or operation needs to run according to its input size.

**There are different types of time complexities used. Class one Discuss This 2 Type 
**
1. Constant time – O (1)

2. Linear time – O (n)

#### Constant time – O (1)
An algorithm is said to have constant time with order O (1) when it is not dependent on the input size n. Irrespective of the input size n, the runtime will always be the same.

#### Linear time – O(n)
An algorithm is said to have a linear time complexity when the running time increases linearly with the length of the input. When the function involves checking all the values in an input data, such function has Time complexity with this order O(n).
